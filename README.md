# Online-Book-Search
ASP.Net MVC sample application for online book search

This project was created using ".NET Framework 6.0 (LTS)" on Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.
For ease and purpose of model based development I have used ASP.Net Core Web App(MVC Architecture).
This sample doesnot require much configuration once cloned but the user has to provide the Bearer Key to authenticate the API as below

1) Open the .json file from the below path
  ..\BookSearch\Properties\launchSettings.json
  
2) Find the "BEARER_KEY" property under "profiles" section

3) Visit the below link to get your Bearer Key
   https://the-one-api.dev/documentation

4) Fill in the "BEARER_KEY" variable with your Key obtained as above.
